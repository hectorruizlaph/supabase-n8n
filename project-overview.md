Company: Shadowlight Video
Position: AI Automation Developer.
Challenge Instructions:
Quick Note Before You Start
Your time matters, and so does ours.
This challenge is designed to show us what you can actually build, not just whatâ€™s on your resume. It mirrors the type of work youâ€™ll handle as an AI Automation Developer: Client Transformation Specialist: creating automations that directly transform businesses.
We want to see how you think, how you use tools, and how you solve problems.
Hereâ€™s the deal:
This is optional, but we only review candidates who complete it.

We know it takes timeâ€¦thatâ€™s why weâ€™ll send a $300 cash bonus after your first month if youâ€™re hired, as thanks for putting in the effort.

If youâ€™re excited by real-world impact and building automations that drive growth, this is your chance to prove it.

Bottom line: weâ€™re looking for people who take pride in their craft and can deliver working automations quickly.

The Challenge
ðŸ‘‰ Please watch these Loom videos before starting:
Challenge Overview â€“ Part 1

Challenge Overview â€“ Part 2 (BONUS)

Part 1 â€“ To-Do List App (Foundation)
Build a simple to-do list app with the following requirements:
Framework: Next.js

Database: Supabase (data must persist â€” no local storage)

Hosting: Vercel

AI Assistant: Use Cursor (preferred) or Lovable/Bolt

Core Features:
Add a task

Edit a task

Mark a task complete

Data persists after refresh

Store in Supabase (basic user identifier like name/email is fine)

Part 2 â€“ Chatbot Enhancement
Extend your app with a chatbot interface:
Integrate with N8N (mandatory)

Chatbot connects with Supabase (directly or via your own API â€” API gets bonus points)

When a task is added, call an AI to enhance the title (e.g., make it clearer, break it into steps, or enrich it with relevant info).

Bonus Points:
Add WhatsApp integration (Evolution API or similar).

Use a filter so only messages with #to-do list trigger the bot.

Deliverables
When finished, please submit:
N8N Access (so we can view your workflow)

Deployed Webapp URL

GitHub Repo URL (public)

Loom Video (5-10 minutes max) explaining your solution and key decisions

Submission Instructions
Complete Parts 1 & 2 (and bonus if youâ€™d like).

Package your deliverables (N8N access, URLs, Loom).

Deployed webapp link

Loom video link (max 5 minutes)

Deadline: Submit within 3 days of receiving this challenge.

Weâ€™ll assess based on:
Functionality â€“ Does it work as expected?
